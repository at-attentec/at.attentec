Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.


Setup
=====

1. Setup database settings in config/database.yml
2. To get the newest database structure run:
    rake db:migrate 

3. Set the version of your rails in config/environment.rb

Debug 
=====

To be able to debug an object, like var_dump() in PHP, the function var_dump is defined in applications_helper.rb
This works well in both testCases and templates

Ex:
var_dump @user
<%= var_dump @user %>

You can also use p to get debug output into the server console.

Ex:
p @user

To show error messages from an ActiveRecord object during for example tests, you can use p_errors

Ex:
p_errors @user
